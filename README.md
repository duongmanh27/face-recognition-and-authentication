Face Recognition & Authentication System

Technology Stack: Python, OpenCV, PyQt5, Facenet/InsightFace, SQLite.

Overview: Developed a real-time face recognition system that authenticates users by comparing facial embeddings.

Key Contributions:

  Designed a responsive PyQt5 interface to guide users in positioning their faces within an overlayed elliptical frame.
  
  Implemented image pre-processing functions (brightness enhancement, sharpness detection, face cropping) to ensure high-quality input.
  
  Extracted face embeddings using deep learning models and computed cosine similarity for robust identity verification.
  
  Managed user data storage through an SQLite database, including student ID, facial landmarks, bounding boxes, and encoded face images.
  
  Integrated user dialogs for seamless face registration and confirmation, enhancing user experience and data accuracy.
